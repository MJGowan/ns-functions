### Random Name Generator
A function that will generate a single student at random.

### Random Group Generator
A function that will generate groups of different sizes based on user input.

### Rock Paper Scissors
A function to play rock paper scissors against a CPU. Good for making minor decisions if you are unable to decide on your own.

### Red Light Green Light
A function allowing users to pick between red, yellow, and green to represent how they are feeling about the current speed of the lecture.
This will display all students' colors on a pie chart, changing in real-time to allow users to anonymously express themselves, and allowing lecturers some insight into whether or not the class may want them to slow down.
